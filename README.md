I love cities, the color red and coding. Combine the three and you get this made with THREE.js :)
My portfolio website made with HTML, CSS & mainly Javascript also including THREE.js a javascript library.
Blender was also used to create objects, triangulate faces for better performances, armature movements
and much more.
